An aquatic roguelike by Jonathan Whiting.

This version of Sunk Coast is a port to GLFW 3 so that
it can build on modern systems.

------------------------------------------------------

You're flat broke. Legends tell of priceless golden
doubloons sunk two hundred fathoms deep. You promised
not to do anything stupid, but then again your family
need to eat. You strap your final cylinder to your
back, adjust your regulator and dive into the water.

Controls:
  Movement: Arrows or wsad or hjkl or numpad dirs.
    Pickup: p 
      drOp: o 
       Use: u 
      diVe: v 
      Rise: r

Executables:
  Windows executable: sunkcoast.exe
    Linux executable: sunkcoast
  If you are using the linux build you must have glfw
  and DevIL runtimes installed. On ubuntu the packages
  are 'libglfw3' and 'libdevil1c2'.
